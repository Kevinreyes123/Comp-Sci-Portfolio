	<h1>Things about Me!</h1>
	<p> I am fifteen years old. On my free time I like to play sports. The sport that I like the most baseball. I like baseball because you get to hit a ball as hard as you can and people will cheer for you if you hit the ball hard enough and get a home run. Other hobbies that I like to do is camping. When I go camping I go with my uncle and cousins. We get to ride Dirt Bikes. We go all the way to to a city named Hollister to ride my uncle's dirt bikes. My cousin is alot faster than me because he has been riding ever since my uncle bought him his dirt bike. I also like to mountain bike. I also go with my uncle because he knows where the mountain biking place is. I like mountain biking because you can ride your bike as fast as you want down the hill. Once we went mountain biking with my older cousin and my younger cousin and my younger cousin pressed the front brake while going down a hill and flipped over and almost fell down te rest of the hill. That is just a little about me.

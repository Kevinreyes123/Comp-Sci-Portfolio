        <p>   Hello my name is Kevin. I am fifteen years old. I attend Everest Public High School. Everest is very diferent to other schools because the school is very small. We use Chromebooks for most of our work. While I'm writing this we are doing expiditions. Expiditions is a course we take every 6 weeks for 2 weeks. We can choose whichever expidition you want for example we can choose cumputer science, Rock ensemble, etc... I chose this Expidition because I wanted to learn how to code and make programs. We are currently learning how to code on html and css programs. In this class I installed a program named linux which lets us see the code of the program. We also got the chance to dismantle a laptop. We took apart the whole computer to the motherboard and cpu. The easyiest part of of the disamantle of the laptop was taking it apart because you just need to take out the screws from where they are.</p>
